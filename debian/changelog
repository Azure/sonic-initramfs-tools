initramfs-tools (0.40ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Use tmpfs for /dev, instead of ramfs; as tmpfs is swappable.
  * Move /proc and /sys to the real filesystem, rather than unmounting them;
    slightly reduces workload.
  * Replace /root with ${rootmnt} in final usage of /dev/console
  * Copy across modprobe blacklist as well as aliases

  * Change the panic/breaknow thing *again*.  There's now a break= option
    which can be any of top, modules, premount, mount, bottom, init and
    causes the initramfs to break at that point.  panic/breaknow is now
    break=top, without an argument is equivalent to break=premount.
  * Run depmod at the top of the init script, so init-top scripts can use
    modprobe.

  * Remove udev-specific code:
    - depend on the version of udev that includes all of these things itself
    - remove udevstart from init
    - remove code to move /dev to the real filesystem from init
    - remove /sys-based module loading from load_modules
    - remove boot_events functions from load_modules
    - remove udev copy from mkinitramfs

    if I thought it did.

  * init: init variable should be lower case.  Exported ROOT variable
    should be upper case.

initramfs-tools (0.10) breezy; urgency=low

  The "I can see you!" release.

  * Unconditionally require busybox.  Might revert this eventually
    but it's too much of a pain right now do this without
    a reasonably environment

  * Use modprobe to load modules

  * Iterate through /sys/bus/pci and /sys/bus/usb and load drivers
    based on their modalias

  * Start to use /sbin for things

  * Include depmod in the image.  Use it at boot time.

    manually for this build.

    can see them.

  * Honour command line 'ro' or 'rw' settings for nfs.

 -- Jeff Bailey <jbailey@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Jun 2005 21:35:14 +0000

initramfs-tools (0.7) breezy; urgency=low

  The "CONFORM!" release.

  * Make command line arguments almost match mkinitrd.  The -m argument
    doesn't make any sense, so it's not supported.  Add support for
    overriding the confdir, and specifying version no longer expects -v.

  * Add sed and grep to the initramfs for now.  Will prune these
    eventually, but for now mdrun needs them.

  * Add mdadm and mdrun to the initramfs.

  * Add hookscript directories.

  * Call hookscripts

  Thanks to David Weinhall <tao@acc.umu.se> for the dependancy-based
  hookscripts.

  * arch:all, not arch:any
